# 50th Beers :beer:

50th beers is an online blog where I document the tasting notes that I make to various fermented, distilled, spirits and other beverages as a hobby.
This project began with the challenge proposed by a close friend of mine, who, knowing the diversity of beers in Spain, challenged me to try 50 different beers.
